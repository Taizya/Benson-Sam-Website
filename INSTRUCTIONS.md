## TODO

**Always make sure the content in the section is horizontally and vertically centered**
**Do not run any npm commands**
**Always use em for sizing in css**

- Make the following changes in the @src/pages/about.astro

1. Modify the css of the h2 in the call-to-action div to have font size of --font-size-h2 which are defined in the global.css
   file

2. I want you to align the content horizontally and vertically within the section. It should be dead in the center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not change anything in the @src/pages/index.astro and @src/styles/home.css
